# sleepHRV
The project aim was to design a graphical user interface to calculate time-domain and frequency domain features 
from heart beat-to-beat intervals (RR intervals).  This GUI, unlike the other available HRV analysis toolboxes (e.g., Kubios),
calculates the HRV variables during different sleep stages. The user can browse RR intervals and sleep stage markers, 
and optionally select analysis window size to get an output from the HRV analysis.
